**Module 15 Challenge - Mapping**

In this scenario, I built an interactive map to show Earthquakes in different locations on Earth over the last 7 days. This was achieved by using Javascript, CSS and HTML coding.

The Earthquake data was sourced from the United States Geological Survey API: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
